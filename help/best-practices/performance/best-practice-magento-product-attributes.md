This article provides best practices for the maximum recommended number of product attributes in Adobe Commerce.

These maximum recommended number of product attributes limits are:

* For Adobe Commerce on-premises and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure versions 2.4.1 and lower,
   the limit is 500 product attributes.
* For Adobe Commerce on-premises and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure versions 2.4.2 and higher,
   the limit is 1500 product attributes.

If you exceed the maximum recommended limit, performance can be affected.

Many product attributes affects the size of the Product template saved for each product (EAV structure). This leads to:

* Increase of SQL queries related to EAV data retrieval and size of data processed and as a result decrease of DB throughput
* Significant increase in full-text search index size
* Increase in EAV index size
* Reaching hard MySQL limits when building a FLAT index for oversized product templates and inability to use it

Response time on most storefront scenarios related to catalog browsing, search (quick and advanced), and layered navigation will be decreased.

Product management operations in the Admin Panel will significantly degrade (slow down) and can lead to timeouts.

Product Mass Actions functionality can be blocked. Index re-build time for mid/large size catalogs cannot be performed on a daily basis due to long execution times.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises, all [supported versions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf)  
* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, all [supported versions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf)

## Best practices

Recommendations are:

* Use different Product templates (attribute sets) for different products
* Leverage custom options and complex products for variations management
* Minimize the number of searchable attributes
* Remove non-used product properties
* Store and manage non-commerce related attributes in external PMS systems
