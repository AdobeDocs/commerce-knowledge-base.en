This article provides best practices for using `robots.txt` in Adobe Commerce. This includes configuration and security. The `robots.txt` file is a text file that instructs web robots (typically search engine robots) how to crawl pages on their website.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises, all [supported versions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf)  
* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, all [supported versions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf)

## Best practices

 **<u>Configuration:</u>**

* By not configuring the `robots.txt` file, site performance can be negatively impacted, leading to a potential for site outages.
* Configure the `robots.txt` file to avoid unnecessary Bots scanning and indexing the wrong content. For steps, refer to [Search Engine Robots](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/search-engine-robots.html) in our user guide.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline"> **Security:** </span>

Do not expose your Commerce Admin path in your `robots.txt` file. Having the Admin path exposed is a vulnerability for site hacking and potential loss of data. Remove the Admin path from the `robots.txt` file.

For steps to edit the `robots.txt` file and remove all entries of the Admin path, refer to [Marketing User Guide > SEO and Search > Search Engine Robots](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/search-engine-robots.html) in our user guide.
