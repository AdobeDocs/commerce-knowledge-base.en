title: UPS APIs deprecated
description: UPS APIs are temporarily deprecated as the Adobe Commerce integration with UPS do not currently support the OAuth 2.0 security model. We expect to get it supported at the end of this year. This does not impact current users with generated API keys as UPS will support authentication via APIs keys to June 3, 2024. Merchants without generated keys cannot use our integration but they can use existing integration from marketplace.
