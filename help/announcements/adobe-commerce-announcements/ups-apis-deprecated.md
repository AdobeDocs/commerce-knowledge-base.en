title: UPS APIs deprecated
description: UPS APIs are temporarily deprecated as the Adobe Commerce integration with UPS does not currently support the OAuth 2.0 security model. However, we expect to support this model by the end of this year. This does not impact current merchants with generated API keys as UPS will support authentication via APIs keys to June 3, 2024. Merchants without generated keys cannot use our integration, but they can use an existing integration from the marketplace.

# UPS APIs deprecated

United Postal Service (UPS) APIs are temporarily deprecated as the Adobe Commerce integration with UPS does not currently support the OAuth 2.0 security model. However, we expect to enable support for this model by the end of this year. This does not impact current merchants with generated APIs keys as UPS will support authentication via APIs keys to June 3, 2024. Merchants without generated keys cannot use our integration, but they can use an existing integration from the marketplace.
