# Adobe Commerce support intake process migration to Experience League

We're excited to announce that in our journey to be better connected to the Adobe family of solutions, Adobe Commerce will be migrating our support intake process from the Adobe Commerce Help Center to Adobe Experience League on July 15th, 2024. Experience League is currently home to Adobe Commerce self-help documentation, user guides, and best practices, and will become your primary resource for all support needs from self-service to agent-driven communication. We appreciate your understanding and support as we make this important transition.
