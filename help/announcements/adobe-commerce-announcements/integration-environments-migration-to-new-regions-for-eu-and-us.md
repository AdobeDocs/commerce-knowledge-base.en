In order to provide you with the most up-to-date infrastructure foundation, we are migrating the Integration environments for all customers belonging to the legacy ‘EU’ region to a new EU region. The rest of the regions – EU-3, EU-5, EU-6 – will remain the same.  

The migrations will be happening from June 6th to June 15th, 2022.

If this change affects you, you will receive a notification from Adobe containing the exact time when your migration will happen and all other necessary details.  

Keep in mind that this migration will only affect your Integration environments. There will be no Production downtime and no change to the Stage or Production URLs.

Once the migration is complete, you will need to update your repository address in your local repo as well as any third-party systems which you have integrated with the current Integration environments.
