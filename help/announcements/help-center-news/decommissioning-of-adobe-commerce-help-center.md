# Decommissioning of Adobe Commerce Help Center

In our journey to be better connected to the Adobe family of solutions, Adobe Commerce has migrated our support intake process from Adobe Commerce Help Center to Adobe Experience League.
On July 29, 2024, Adobe Commerce Help Center was placed in a read-only status, and all new support cases are now submitted through [Adobe Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Commerce support has migrated from Adobe Commerce Help Center to Adobe Experience League.<br>**Use the Experience League case form flow described [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide?lang=en#what-is-experience-support) to submit support cases.**

## When will the Adobe Commerce Help Center site be decommissioned?

**On September 3, 2024, Adobe Commerce Help Center will no longer be accessible**, and you will no longer be able to view historic support cases created in that system.
**<u>Please save any support cases or information you wish to retain by saving them to PDF in your browser prior to September 3, 2024.</u>**
If you would like to review historical support cases created in Adobe Commerce Help Center after September 3, 2024, you will need to open a support case in Adobe Experience League and request that information from the support team.

>[!NOTE]

>The Knowledge Base part of the Adobe Commerce Help Center has also migrated to the [Adobe Experience League portal](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/). When you create a support ticket, related Knowledge Base articles will be suggested to you, along with other relevant Adobe Commerce documentation from Adobe Experience League.
