# Monitoring fact sheet for [!DNL Adobe Commerce on cloud pro infrastructure]

This document provides information about Adobe Commerce infrastructure monitoring and notifications.

Monitoring enables merchants, system integrators, and Adobe's internal teams to troubleshoot site availability and insufficient disk space.

## Problem troubleshooting and resolution

Adobe Commerce instances generally contain custom code and configurations. Adobe does not support nor resolve issues with custom code and configurations. Adobe does help merchants troubleshoot and identify issues in our knowledge base and provide recommended solutions and best practices for prevention and resolution. We encourage merchants and partners to use the tables below to understand what is monitored and who is responsible for resolution.

When notifications are triggered, the Adobe Commerce support team will triage the issue. As part of the triage, error logs, and other resources are analyzed. Based on the triage, additional [!DNL Zendesk] support tickets are created either to merchants or partners (in case of custom updates) or to Adobe's internal teams to resolve the issue.

## Adobe Commerce: default monitoring

The below events are monitored and the Adobe Commerce team take necessary steps to resolve and communicate issues identified.

 | **Notification recipient** | Merchant/Partner and Adobe. |
