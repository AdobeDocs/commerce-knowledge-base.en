# FAQ for the 2024 and 2023 Adobe Commerce Release Strategy and Lifecycle Policy

## 2024 and 2023 Release Strategy and Updated Lifecycle Policy

### How is the Adobe Commerce Software Lifecycle Policy changing in 2023 and 2024?

To meet the mission-critical needs of Adobe Commerce customers, we are expanding our support window for Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 and later versions to **3 years from the version [!DNL GA] date**. Support includes **both security and quality patches**. 

### How will these changes benefit customers?

The longer support window recognizes the complexity our customers face operating multiple sites around the globe and enables them to get more value from each deployment. Customers can stay on releases for a longer period, which reduces total cost of ownership and frees resources to focus on adding new functionality or customizing the buying experience to drive faster growth.

### Where can customers find our current lifecycle policy?

The [Adobe Commerce Software Lifecycle Policy](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/legal/terms/enterprise/pdfs/Adobe-Commerce-Software-Lifecycle-Policy.pdf) is available online.

### When will customers on 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 reach end-of-support under this new policy?

Customers on Adobe Commerce 2.4.4+ will receive security and quality fixes for 3 years from the version [!DNL GA] date as shown in the timeline below. See the [Released Versions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/release/versions.html) page on [!DNL Experience League] for specific end-of-support dates.

### How is the Adobe Commerce release schedule changing?

To accelerate innovation and reduce the total cost of ownership, there will be one core application patch released per year, with new capabilities delivered as composable [!DNL SaaS] services that can be added at any time.

### How does the new release schedule benefit customers?

Delivering new capabilities as composable [!DNL SaaS] services provides customers with faster access to new tools that can help increase their sales. Functionality can be adopted at any time without having to upgrade the core Adobe Commerce application. And these services can be continually updated by Adobe to deliver the latest advances in functionality and performance. Having one core application patch release per year helps to reduce upgrade costs, makes it easier to plan for upgrades, and provides more time for customizing and optimizing the commerce experience. Additional lightweight security patches help customers stay more secure.

### What is pre-release access?

In 2023, customers can access Adobe Commerce patch releases approximately two weeks before general availability.

Beginning in 2024, Adobe no longer provides "pre-release" access to patches. Instead, for 2.4.7 and later, customers can use [beta releases](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/release/beta.html) to access pre-general availability code for testing and development purposes. Pre-release access is still scheduled for the following 2023 releases:

* August 8, 2023 pre-release access is July 25, 2023
* October 10, 2023 pre-release access is September 26, 2023

### Where is the Adobe Commerce release schedule posted?

Check out the [Adobe Commerce release schedule](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/release/planning/schedule.html) on [!DNL Experience League] for more details.

### What are the different types of releases included on the schedule?

* **Core application patch releases**: core application upgrade that includes security, performance, and high-priority quality fixes.
* **[!DNL Beta] version patch releases**: non-[!DNL General Availability] code updates to the core Adobe Commerce application that include security, compliance, performance, and high-priority quality fixes. It allows extra time to review code and affected components before patch release [!DNL GA].
* **Extensibility, infrastructure, and services releases**: releases of new features and feature updates that are delivered as composable services, separate from the patch releases. Examples include services like [!DNL Product Recommendations] and [!DNL Live Search], independent modules like [!DNL PWA Studio] and [!DNL Inventory Management] (MSI), and updates to our cloud services and infrastructure.
* **Security patch releases**: security-only updates to the core application released to keep customers secure and compliant.

### Where do customers go to get quality patches?

Quality patches are a way to distribute fixes for individual quality issues. Customers can contact Adobe Support or use the [[!DNL Quality Patch Tool]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/announcements/commerce-announcements/magento-quality-patches-released-new-tool-to-self-serve-quality-patches.html) to find quality patches.

### What resources are available to help with planning, budgeting, and upgrades in general?

Available resources include a comprehensive 2.4 Upgrade Guide, Technical Upgrade Workshop Recording, and the [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool]. A comprehensive list of resources can be found on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/upgrade-guide/resources/recommended-reading.html).

### As a Managed Services customer, how can Customer Engineering help me in the upgrade to 2.4.4+?

Managed Services customers can work with our Customer Engineering team for assistance with several components of the upgrade process, including analysis, upgrading cloud services, quality and user acceptance testing ([!DNL QA] and [!DNL UAT]), and production launch.

## Extended Support Options

### Are there extended support options for customers on versions 2.4.4 and 2.4.5?

While customers are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, a 1-year support extension in no additional cost is offered for all the Adobe Commerce customers on version 2.4.4 and 2.4.5 to provide them greater flexibility to align their upgrade plans with their business needs. 

These plans include both quality and security patches for the core application for up to one year.

### Does extended support ensure [!DNL PCI] compliance?

Under extended support, our Customer Engineering team will continue to provide the same quality and security patches as usual, without any scope degradations. However, customers will need to take additional measures to stay [!DNL PCI]-compliant if underlying third-party technologies, like [!DNL MariaDB], reach end-of-support.  

Adobe does not provide support for third-party technologies that have reached end-of-support. Adobe recommends that customers work with their [[!DNL PCI] assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/qualified_security_assessors/) to ensure compliance. Refer to [Adobe Commerce System Requirements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/system-requirements) for a full list of tested and supported third-party technologies.

* <sup>1</sup> Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 and 2.4.5 Cloud customers will not be affected by [!DNL PHP] 8.1 EOS date during the extended support, since Adobe will be automatically applying lifetime support [!DNL PHP] 8.1 security fixes on their infrastructure.
