We understand the importance of accessibility at Adobe. While the responsibility for accessibility is with the partner/merchant, we continue to improve our accessibility with each release which will also be included in our accessibility improvement plans for 2022.  

Adobe Commerce is highly customizable, and our customers can extend the Luma theme, create their Accessibility Modules, and visit our Commerce Marketplaceâ€¯to find extensions that meet their accessibility requirements.

Many of our customers are using the [W3C Accessibility Standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/) and utilize the [Adobe Accessibility Conformance Report for Adobe Commerce](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/compliance/adobe-commerce-2021-acr.html).

Using industry-standard developer tools, you can work with a key accessibility partner or implement extensions from the Commerce Marketplace based on specific customer requirements or/and the Adobe conformance report.

Solutions can be found in the [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
