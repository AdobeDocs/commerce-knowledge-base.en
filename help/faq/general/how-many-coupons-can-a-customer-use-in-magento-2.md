# How many coupons can a customer use in Adobe Commerce?

For Adobe Commerce versions below 2.4.7, you can configure multiple coupon codes but use **only one coupon code in the cart**.

To use more than one coupon code in the cart simultaneously, you may consider using a corresponding extension in [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).

However, from Adobe Commerce version 2.4.7, you are allowed to configure and use **more than one coupon code in the cart simultaneously**. To enable it, refer to [Multicoupon Settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/config/sales/sales#multicoupon-settings).
