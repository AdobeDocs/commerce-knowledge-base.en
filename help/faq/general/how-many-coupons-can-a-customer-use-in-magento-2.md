# How many coupons can a customer use in Adobe Commerce?

Although Adobe Commerce allows configuring multiple coupon codes, a customer can use **only one coupon code in the cart**.

To use more that one coupon code in the cart simultaneously, you may consider using a corresponding extension in [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
