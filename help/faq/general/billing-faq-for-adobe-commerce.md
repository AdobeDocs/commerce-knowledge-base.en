## Entitlements

Entitlements are what enable you to submit tickets, download modules, and access our support teams. If you try to Submit Ticket and the option has gone missing, are unable to download the B2B module, or other modules your entitlements may have disappeared temporarily. This is usually caused by an issue with your invoicing.

Here are the steps to check that your payments are up-to-date:

1. Have the Primary Account Owner log into account [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com) and navigate to the invoices section.
1. Check to ensure there are no outstanding invoices. Once an invoice is past due by one day, entitlements are temporarily turned off until all invoices have been paid.
1. If you have an unpaid invoice, please pay this as soon as possible. This is quickly done via a CC, and making sure a CC is setup on file. Once Adobe receives payment, your entitlements will come back the same day as payment is received.
1. If you are unsure if your invoices have been paid, or you have sent payment, and are unsure if it has been received, please email Magento Credit Collections [magentocreditcollections@adobe.com](mailto:magentocreditcollections@adobe.com).

**If you do not have any unpaid invoices, please create a support ticket by emailing [helpcenterloginissues@magento.com](mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com) and be sure to also put [magentocreditcollections@adobe.com](mailto:magentocreditcollections@adobe.com) in the CC: line.**

## Access / Payment of Invoices

Only the primary account holder can access the payment/invoice section of their account.
Log in to [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com), then choose the **Products and Services** > Select *Your Specific Product Purchased* > Choose **Pay Now** next to the proper invoice, or choose the invoice.

The first step is to review your contract. Most of those details are included in your contract. If you have any questions not in your contract, please check payments/invoices with our billing teams.  Email: [magentocreditcollections@adobe.com](mailto:magentocreditcollections@adobe.com), and they will be happy to clarify and assist.

**Payment Remittance**, it’s always on the bottom of your invoice.

* We can only accept credit card payments below $75,000.
* **Merchants on monthly billing must pay via credit card on autopay.** [See the CC autopay section](#cc-autopay).
* Merchants on quarterly, semi-annual, and annual can pay via credit card, but it must be done manually by the merchant.
