# Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base Guide will soon be restructured, with its content being moved to other locations within Adobe Experience League. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain and update the content in this guide.

It covers troubleshooting and best practices, hosts announcements, answers FAQs, and highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason) in the official documentation.
