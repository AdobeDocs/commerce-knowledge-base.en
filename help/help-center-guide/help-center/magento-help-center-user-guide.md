<h2 id="what-is">WHAT IS ADOBE COMMERCE HELP CENTER?</h2>

Welcome to Adobe Commerce Help Center! We are here to help solve your Adobe Commerce issues quickly and efficiently.

Adobe Commerce Help Center is the [Knowledge Base](#kb) and the [Ticketing System](#support-tickets). This document shows how to use both of them.

<h2 id="kb">KNOWLEDGE BASE</h2>

When you access the Help Center, you first get to the Adobe Commerce Knowledge Base.

<h3 id="what-is-kb">What is Knowledge Base?</h3>

The Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base is a collection of articles based on the support tickets that Adobe Commerce Customers or Partners submit.

Every Knowledge Base article covers a real-life issue or question and may be viewed as a reply to a submitted support ticket helping others to solve a similar problem.

<h3 id="kb-devdocs-user-guide">Knowledge Base does not replace DevDocs or User Guide</h3>

The information in the Knowledge Base is designed as complementary to [DevDocs](http://devdocs.magento.com/), the [User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html), and [other Adobe Commerce publications](https://magento.com/resources/technical), and only covers troubleshooting, best practices, hosts announcements, answers FAQ's, or highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason) in the official documentation.

<h3 id="search-for-articles">Search for articles</h3>

You don't need to be logged in to the Adobe Commerce Help Center to search for articles in the Adobe Commerce Knowledge Base.

To search for articles, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Knowledge Base landing page at <https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us>.
1. In the **Search** field, start entering the keywords that an article should have. For example, *Redis*, *error*, *configuration management*, etc.

    <img src = "assets/search-field-1.png" alt = "search-field" width="800px">
1. The top article suggestions are displayed below the **Search** field.
1. Select an article from the list and click it.

    <img src = "assets/search-article-2.png" alt = "search-field" width="800px">
1. If you want the results of your search to be displayed on a new page:
    * Do not select an article from the suggestion list
    * After typing your search query, press Enter on your keyboard

        <img src = "assets/search-enter-3.png" alt = "search-enter" width="800px">

The search is not limited to the article title but also includes the article text; the most relevant matches are displayed first.

You can also select the article **Tags** on the bottom-left of the Search results page to select articles with those specific word tags that you are searching for.

You can search for articles using the **Search** field on any page of the Knowledge Base.

<h3 id="navigate-articles">Navigate articles using Categories</h3>

All articles in the Knowledge Base are grouped into Categories. They are:

* **Announcements:** articles with timely news and helpful information.
* **Best Practices:** articles with recommended techniques and procedures that are prescribed as most effective.
* **Troubleshooting:** articles that show how to solve a particular issue. For example, if you cannot perform an operation because of an error message, this is where you might find the solution.
* **How To:** articles with detailed steps on how to perform a particular operation.
* **FAQ:** answers to the most common, frequently asked questions.

To find articles through navigating the categories, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Knowledge Base landing page at <https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us>.
1. Click a category.
1. The list of all articles in that category is displayed. Browse through the articles, find the one you need, then click it.

<h3 id="rate-articles">Rate articles</h3>

You may help us improve our articles by letting us know your opinion. At the bottom of every article, click **Yes** or **No** to answer the question **Was this article helpful?**

Please vote, your opinion matters!

<h3 id="no-submit-link">"Submit a ticket" link not displayed on Adobe Commerce Help Center start page</h3>

#### Issue

You access the Adobe Commerce Help Center and want to submit a support request, but the **Submit a ticket** link is not displayed on the Help Center start page.

#### Cause

One of the following might be the cause:

* You have not logged in to the Help Center.
* If using shared access for the first time, you have not performed the steps required to ensure that Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com.
* Your account is not entitled for Adobe Commerce support (for example, you are not a paying Commerce customer or you are an Open Source customer).

#### Solution

[Log in to Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000913794#provide-shared-access).

The **Submit a ticket** link will only be displayed for customers with an email linked to a valid support agreement.

#### Using shared access account

To be able to use shared access account to submit support tickets, you need to perform the following (this needs to be done only once):

1. After receiving [shared access](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052444712#who-can-provide-shared-access), log in to your [Magento Account on the magento.com website](https://account.magento.com/).
1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.
1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Adobe Commerce Help Center.

#### Still don't see the **Submit a ticket** link

If you don’t have **Shared Accounts** under the **Switch Accounts** drop-down list, but you are working for a client who has an Adobe Commerce license, please ask them to grant you Shared Access. For more details review [Provide shared access to Magento Account](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000913794#provide-shared-access).

If you are an Adobe Commerce license owner, please verify that you don’t have an invoice with **Pending Payment** status. Support entitlements are automatically granted or revoked according to invoice payment status.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">How To Check Your Payment Status</span>:

1. Log in to [magento.com](http://support.magento.com/).
1. Click on **Billing History** on the left.
1. If you **do** have an invoice with **Pending Payment** status, **please contact your Customer Success Manager** to have the payment issue resolved.

We provide support only to Adobe Commerce license owners and accounts which have Shared Access to an account with an Adobe Commerce license. If you need support for the Magento Open Source edition, please utilize these self-help technical resources:

* [Adobe Commerce Help Center](https://support.magento.com/)
* [Adobe Commerce Developer Documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com/)
* [Adobe Commerce documentation resources](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce.html)
* [Magento Forums](https://community.magento.com/?_ga=2.99592990.1084044056.1559046120-720752292.1551793747)

If you are having issues logging in to your account or believe Shared Access was set up correctly, but you still cannot see **Submit a ticket** button, please email [Help Center login issues](mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com), and we will gladly review your account settings and support entitlements.

<h3 id="verify-email-address">
<em>"Please verify your email address"</em> error on the Magento Account page</h3>

You won't be able to submit a support ticket if you receive the *Please verify your email address* error similar to the one below on the [Magento Account page](https://account.magento.com/).

<img src = "assets/Verify_Email_Address_Error.png" alt = "Verify_Email_Address_Error" width="800px">

The solution is to validate your email address:

1. Click on the **Validate Email** button below the Email field on the [Edit Account Information](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/edit/) page similar to the one below.   

    <img src = "assets/Validate_Email_Solution.png" alt = "Validate_Email_Solution" width="800px">

1. Clicking the **Validate Email** button will send an email to the email address registered for this Magento Account with a link to validate the email address.
1. Click on the email validation link to validate your email and resolve this issue.
1. If you do not receive an email with an email validation link, please email [Help Center login issues](mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com) and indicate that you cannot validate your email address.

<h3 id="merchant-not-displayed">Ticket submission form: merchant is not displayed in Organization drop-down</h3>

#### Issue

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Prerequisites</span>: you have a shared access account granted by a merchant.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span>:

1. Log in to the Help Center using your shared account.
1. Click the **Submit a ticket** link. The ticket submission form opens.
1. Expand the **Organization** drop-down field to select the merchant.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual result</span>:

The merchant corresponding to the used shared account is not available in the **Organization** options.

#### Solution

After having been granted shared access from the merchant, you need to take the following steps (only once):

1. Log in to your [Magento Account on the magento.com website](https://account.magento.com/).
1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field at the top-right corner, select the shared access account.
1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Adobe Commerce Help Center.

#### **2. Awaiting your reply**

Adobe Commerce support is expecting information from you.

In your reply, you may specify additional technical details of your issue, provide escalation details, or state if the solution, offered by Adobe Commerce support, has proved helpful for your issue. Make sure you provide your replies as soon as you can since Adobe Commerce support cannot proceed with processing your ticket while it is in the **Awaiting your reply** status.

Reference the [Adobe Commerce support ticket lifecycle policy update](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044226072) article for details about timing and notification policy.

#### **3. Solved**

Adobe Commerce support has provided a solution for your issue, and you have agreed it has been helpful. It is you who marks the ticket as **Solved**. If the fixed issue occurs again, you may reopen the ticket, setting its status to back to **Open**.

<h3 id="conversation-in-ticket">Conversation in your ticket</h3>

<h2 id="shared-access">SHARED ACCESS: GRANT PRIVILEGES FOR OTHER USERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>

You may grant limited access to your account for other Magento Account holders. In particular, using the **shared access** functionality, you may provide privileges for trusted employees and service providers to use your Help Center account so that they could work with your support tickets.

You can provide and manage shared access using your Magento Account page at [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/).

<h3 id="who-can-provide-shared-access">Who can provide shared access</h3>

Only the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder) with the according privileges can provide shared access for other users.

Managing users and their access is the customer's responsibility, especially in the shared access perspective. Thus, the Adobe Commerce support team cannot provide shared access to a Magento Account on behalf of a Customer. Customers are encouraged to add users with shared access themselves, using the [Magento Account page](https://account.magento.com/).

Users who have been provided with shared access cannot transfer or grant such access to other users.

1. Find the user who is mentioned as the **Account owner**.
