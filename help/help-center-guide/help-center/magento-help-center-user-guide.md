### "Submit a ticket" link not displayed on Adobe Commerce Help Center start page {#no-submit-link}

#### Issue

You access the Adobe Commerce Help Center and want to submit a support request, but the **Submit a ticket** link is not displayed on the Help Center start page.

#### Cause

One of the following might be the cause:

* You have not logged in to the Help Center.
* If using shared access for the first time, you have not performed the steps required to ensure that Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com.
* Your account is not entitled for Adobe Commerce support (for example, you are not a paying Commerce customer or you are an Open Source customer).

#### Solution

[Log in to Help Center](/help/help-center-guide/help-center/magento-help-center-user-guide.md#provide-shared-access).

The **Submit a ticket** link will only be displayed for customers with an email linked to a valid support agreement.

#### Using shared access account

To be able to use shared access account to submit support tickets, you need to perform the following (this needs to be done only once):

1. After receiving [shared access](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052444712#who-can-provide-shared-access), log in to your [Magento Account on the magento.com website](https://account.magento.com/).
1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.
1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Adobe Commerce Help Center.

#### Still don't see the **Submit a ticket** link

If you don't have **Shared Accounts** under the **Switch Accounts** drop-down list, but you are working for a client who has an Adobe Commerce license, please ask them to grant you Shared Access. For more details review [Provide shared access to Magento Account](/help/help-center-guide/help-center/magento-help-center-user-guide.md#provide-shared-access).

If you are an Adobe Commerce license owner, please verify that you don't have an invoice with **Pending Payment** status. Support entitlements are automatically granted or revoked according to invoice payment status.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">How To Check Your Payment Status</span>:

1. Log in to [magento.com](https://support.magento.com/).
1. Click on **Billing History** on the left.
1. If you **do** have an invoice with **Pending Payment** status, **please contact your Adobe Account Team** to have the payment issue resolved.

We provide support only to Adobe Commerce license owners and accounts which have Shared Access to an account with an Adobe Commerce license. If you need support for the Magento Open Source edition, please utilize these self-help technical resources:

* [Adobe Commerce Help Center](https://support.magento.com/)
* [Adobe Commerce Developer Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs/)
* [Adobe Commerce documentation resources](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce.html)
* [Magento Forums](https://community.magento.com/?_ga=2.99592990.1084044056.1559046120-720752292.1551793747)

If you are having issues logging in to your account or believe Shared Access was set up correctly, but you still cannot see **Submit a ticket** button, please email [Help Center login issues](mailto:grp-magento-helpcenterloginissues@adobe.com), and we will gladly review your account settings and support entitlements.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are having an issue with accessing your cloud project, submit the ticket for this issue through the regular channels. Do not send an email if you are able to submit a ticket.

### "Please verify your email address" error on the Magento Account page {#verify-email-address}

You won't be able to submit a support ticket if you receive the *Please verify your email address* error similar to the one below on the [Magento Account page](https://account.magento.com/).

![Verify_Email_Address_Error](assets/Verify_Email_Address_Error.png){width="800"}

The solution is to validate your email address:

1. Log in to https://account.adobe.com and request a password if needed.
1. Verify your Adobe account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This only applies to the email validation link from https://account.magento.com (Magento Account page).

### Ticket submission form: merchant is not displayed in Organization drop-down {#merchant-not-displayed}

#### Issue

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Prerequisites</span>: you have a shared access account granted by a merchant.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span>:

1. Log in to the Help Center using your shared account.
1. Click the **Submit a ticket** link. The ticket submission form opens.
1. Expand the **Organization** drop-down field to select the merchant.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected result</span>:

The merchant corresponding to the shared account is listed in the **Organization** options.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual result</span>:

The merchant corresponding to the used shared account is not available in the **Organization** options.

#### Solution

After having been granted shared access from the merchant, you need to take the following steps (only once):

1. Log in to your [Magento Account on the magento.com website](https://account.magento.com/).
1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field at the top-right corner, select the shared access account.
1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Adobe Commerce Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Adobe Commerce Help Center.

If you have already done this, check if you have been granted *shared access from more than one merchant* by clicking on the [[!UICONTROL Shared with me] tab on your account](https://account.magento.com/grantor/manage/shared/):
* If only one [!UICONTROL Share Name] is listed, i.e., you have only been granted by one merchant, *you will not see an [!UICONTROL Organization] drop-down*.
* If there are multiple [!UICONTROL Share Names], the merchant's support entitlements may have expired because their license was previously revoked due to payment issues.

### Track your tickets {#track-tickets}

Your tickets are those that you:

* have submitted personally
* have been added to as a watcher through a CC (carbon copy)

To follow/unfollow tickets for an organization:

1. Go to **My tickets** > **Organization tickets** tab.

## SHARED ACCESS: GRANT PRIVILEGES FOR OTHER USERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT {#shared-access}

You may grant limited access to your account for other Adobe Commerce account holders. In particular, using the **shared access** functionality, you may provide privileges for trusted employees and service providers to use your Help Center account so that they could work with your support tickets.

You can provide and manage shared access using your Adobe Commerce account page at [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/).

### Who can provide shared access {#who-can-provide-shared-access}

Only the account owner (primary account holder) with the according privileges can provide shared access for other users.

Managing users and their access is the customer's responsibility, especially in the shared access perspective. Thus, the Adobe Commerce support team cannot provide shared access to an Adobe Commerce account on behalf of a Customer. Customers are encouraged to add users with shared access themselves, using the [Adobe Commerce account page](https://account.magento.com/).

Users who have been provided with shared access cannot transfer or grant such access to other users.

### Provide shared access {#provide-shared-access}

See the [Share a Commerce account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/commerce-account/commerce-account-share) section of Adobe Commerce Getting Started Guide for detailed steps on setting up a shared account.

After providing shared access for a new user, the related information is available in **Shared Access** > **Manage Permissions** of your Adobe Commerce account page.

![magento-account-shared-manage-permissions](assets/magento_account_shared_manage_permissions.png)

### Revoke (delete) shared access {#revoke-shared-access}

1. In the panel on the left, under Shared Access, choose **Manage Permissions.**

1. Click **Delete User** to revoke access or X in the top corner to cancel revoking.

   ![revoke_shared_access](assets/revoke_shared_access.png){width="800"}

   You may also revoke shared access using the **Edit** menu:

### How to delete users who were granted shared access via a Cloud project? {#remove-cloud-shared-access-users}

<u>Affected products and versions</u>

* Adobe Commerce Cloud (all versions)

<u>Cause</u>

If you have/had an Adobe Commerce Cloud project and had added a user to the project, they would have been automatically granted Shared Access on the Project Owner's MAGE ID. This would normally be indicated in the **[!UICONTROL Share Name]** column, showing *Cloud Shared Access from MAG[XYZ]*.

If the DELETE link is missing, that means that Shared Access was automatically granted through Commerce Cloud.

<u>Solution</u>

It's not possible to delete the list of Shared Access users with the Share Name of *Cloud Shared Access from MAG[XYZ]* if the Shared Access wasn't added/given on this page. These are retained for informational/audit purposes.

However, once you have revoked the permissions on those Shared Access users, they will no longer have that access.

1. Log in to your Adobe Commerce account at [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/).
1. In the panel on the left, under *[!UICONTROL Shared Access]*, choose **[!UICONTROL Manage Permissions]**.
1. Find the user to revoke shared access from and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the user's row (*[!UICONTROL Actions]* column).
1. Uncheck all resources under *[!UICONTROL Grant Account Permissions]*.

![grant-account-permissions-image](assets/help-center-user-guide-grant-account-permissions-image.png){width="800"}

For more information, please refer to the [Manage User Access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access.html#manage-users-from-the-project-web-interface) documentation on our Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure Guide.

### Access shared account (switch accounts) {#switch-accounts}

To use the shared access provided for you, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Adobe Commerce account at [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/).
1. Click the **Switch Accounts** menu and select an account.

   ![magento-account-shared-switch](assets/magento_account_shared_switch.png){width="800"}

To know which account you are currently using (your own native account or shared access), see the **Switch Accounts** menu: it displays the active account.
