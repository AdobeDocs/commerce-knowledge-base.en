This article provides a patch for the known Adobe Commerce 2.3.0 limitation related to not having the ability to process Cybersource payments from both storefront and the Commerce Admin, if they are on different domains.

>![info]
>
>The core Adobe Commerce Cybersource payment integration is deprecated since 2.3.3 and will be completely removed in 2.4.0. Use the [official extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/cybersource-global-payment-management.html) from marketplace instead.

## Issue

The previous implementation of the Cybersource integration allowed processing payments from one domain only. As a result, if your Adobe Commerce storefront is on different domain from the Commerce Admin, you get the following error when trying to place an order using Cybersource in the Admin: " *Load denied by X-Frame-Options: https://%your\_domain%/cybersource/SilentOrder/TokenResponse/ does not permit cross-origin framing.* .."

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span>:

1. Set up Admin on a different subdomain.
1. Configure Cybersource for the store under **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment Methods** > **CyberSource**.
1. Go to **Sales** > **Orders**.
1. Create new order.
1. Create new customer.
1. Enter customer details.
1. Enter order details (products, shipping method).
1. Select Cybersource as the payment method.
1. Submit order.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected result</span>: Order is placed with no issues.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual result</span>: The Order page shows a loading icon, but the order is never placed. The error is displayed in console.

## Solution

The attached patch provides the improvement for the integration with Cybersource. After applying the patch, you need to create one more profile with Cybersource for processing payments in the Admin, and add the required credentials in the Cybersource configuration in the Commerce Admin under **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment Methods** > **CyberSource**.

>The improvement is included in Adobe Commerce on-premises and cloud infrastructure 2.2.9 and 2.3.1.
