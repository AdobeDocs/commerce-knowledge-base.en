## How to tell whether the patches have been applied

Considering that it is not possible to easily check if the issue was patched, you might want to check whether the MDVA-43395 and MDVA-43443 patches have been successfully applied.

You can do this by taking the following steps:

1. [Install the Quality Patches Tool](https://devdocs.magento.com/quality-patches/usage.html).
1. Run the following command: `vendor/bin/magento-patches -n status |grep "43395|43443|Status"`
1. You should see this output - MDVA-43395 returns the *N/A* status and MDVA-43443 returns the *Applied* status:

```bash
║ Id            │ Title                                                        │ Category        │ Origin                 │ Status      │ Details                                          ║
║ N/A           │ ../m2-hotfixes/MDVA-43443_EE_2.4.3-p1_COMPOSER_v1.patch      │ Other           │ Local                  │ Applied     │ Patch type: Custom                               ║
║ MDVA-43395    │ Parser token fix                                             │ Other           │ Adobe Commerce Support │ N/A         │ Patch type: Required                             ║
