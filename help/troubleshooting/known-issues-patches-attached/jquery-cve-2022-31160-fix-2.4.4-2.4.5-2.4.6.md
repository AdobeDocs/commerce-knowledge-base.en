# JQuery UI security vulnerability [!DNL CVE-2022-31160] fix for 2.4.4, 2.4.5, and 2.4.6 releases

There is a security vulnerability [[!DNL CVE-2022-31160]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31160) reported for [!DNL jQuery-UI] library version 1.13.1 which is used as a dependency in Adobe Commerce 2.4.4, 2.4.5, and 2.4.6. Adobe is not aware of any exploits for this issue. This security vulnerability has been fixed in [!DNL jQuery-UI] library version 1.13.2.

In June 2023 Adobe released 2.4.6-p1, 2.4.5-p3, and 2.4.4-p4 security-only patches where [!DNL jQuery-UI] library dependency was upgraded to the latest 1.13.2 version. However, you must apply one of the two patches attached to this article, for a complete fix.

The main [!DNL jQuery-UI] file was upgraded but there were [!DNL jQuery-UI] supplemental module and widget files that were not upgraded. If you are using Adobe Commerce 2.4.6-p1, 2.4.5-p3, and 2.4.4-p4 or earlier versions, your security scanners might still observe the [!DNL jQuery-UI] CVE issue.

Attached to this article are two patches, one for 2.4.6 versions and 2.4.5 versions, and another one for 2.4.4 versions, which provide complete upgrade of [!DNL JQuery-UI] library to version 1.13.2.

This issue is going to be fixed in the scope of October 2023 release security patches 2.4.6-p3, 2.4.5-p5, or 2.4.4-p6.
