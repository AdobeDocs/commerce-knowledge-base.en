# Adobe Commerce deployment troubleshooter

Stuck deployments and failed deployments on Adobe Commerce can be solved using the Deployment troubleshooter tool. Click on each question to reveal the answer in each step of the troubleshooter.

## Step 1 - Verify the service is running {#step-1}

+++**Is Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure service up?**

Stuck Deployment – Is Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure service up? Check [Adobe Commerce Cloud](https://status.adobe.com/products/3350/).

a. YES – Proceed to [Step 2](#step-2).  
b. NO – Maintenance or global outages. Check for estimated duration and updates.

+++

## Step 2 - Check deployments in other environments {#step-2}

+++**Are there deployments in other environments that are blocking the deployment in the existing environment?**

To get a list of ongoing activities run the following command using magento-cloud CLI (if you have only been added to one cloud project). **Note**: Check you are on the latest version of magento-cloud CLI. For steps, refer to [Update the CLI](/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/dev-tools/cloud-cli/cloud-cli-overview) in the Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure guide. 

```bash
magento-cloud --state=in_progress
```

To get a list of ongoing activities run the following command using magento-cloud CLI (if you have been added to multiple projects):

```bash
magento-cloud -p <project-id or project-url> --state=in_progress
```

To find information about an existing deployment activity (refer to [Checking deployment log if Cloud UI has “log snipped” error](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/checking-deployment-log-if-the-cloud-ui-shows-log-snipped-error.html)
for details) you can run this command to obtain a running log of that activity:

```bash
magento-cloud activity:log <activity-id> [OPTIONAL: <-p project-id or project-url>]
```

a. YES – Troubleshoot the other environment blocking deployment in the existing environment. Proceed to [Step 3](#step-3).
