This article talks about deadlocks in MySQL to help identify and resolve them if they cause a site down, stuck database import, or other Adobe Commerce issues.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises 2.2.x and 2.3.x
* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.2.x and 2.3.x

## Issue

Deadlocks in MySQL occur when two or more transactions mutually hold and request for locks. Deadlocks being present do not always indicate an issue but often are a symptom of some other MySQL or Adobe Commerce issue that has occurred.

Often the application, deployment, or MySQL logs will mention a *"deadlock"* error or the error *"Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction."*

## Cause

Deadlocks can have multiple causes, but the most common is if you perform any interaction (website/processes/cron jobs/other users/MySQL maintenance/MySQL imports) while performing DML/DDL queries at the same time.

As an example, it is a best practice to avoid a stuck MySQL database import by first putting your site in maintenance mode to avoid getting SQL requests to the database that could cause deadlocks and a stuck database import.

## Solution

1. Check your application, deployment, or MySQL logs for deadlock errors:
    * [Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source log locations](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/cli/logging.html)
    * [Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure logs locations](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/trouble/environments-logs.html)
1. Check your MySQL process list for running processes with the command `mysql -e 'show full processlist';`     
1. If on Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, check that MySQL slave is enabled. Consult this article: [Deploy variables (MYSQL\_USE\_SLAVE\_CONNECTION)](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/env/variables-deploy.html#mysql_use_slave_connection).
1. Depending on the errors involved, the solution may present itself, or you may need to include your helpful log information if you need to open a [Support Ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket).
