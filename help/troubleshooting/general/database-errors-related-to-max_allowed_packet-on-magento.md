This article provides a solution for database connection errors in the `var/log/exception.log` that may occur when importing a large number of products or performing another task that forces the server to handle bigger packets than set in `max_allowed_packet` that is larger than the default, 16MB.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises, all [supported versions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf)

## Issue

When a MySQL client or the [mysqld](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) server receives a packet bigger than [max\_allowed\_packet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) bytes, it issues an [ER\_NET\_PACKET\_TOO\_LARGE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_net_packet_too_large) error (which can be seen in the `exception.log`) and closes the connection. With some clients, you may also get a *Lost connection to MySQL server during query* error if the communication packet is too large.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span>

A variety of tasks can produce this issue. This can include trying to import a large number of products into Adobe Commerce or transactional queries sending back too much data. The result is database connection errors in `var/log/exception.log` and other problems, like products not being successfully imported.

## Cause

The default value of 16MB for the MySQL `max_allowed_packets` setting is not large enough for your needs.

## Solution

1. Identify queries where the individual rows exceed the current `max_allowed_packet` limit. Such queries need to be rewritten to reduce the amount of data being returned. This can be done by having a smaller number of columns in the `SELECT` statement or choosing a smaller data type for various columns as part of the table design. If you have a New Relic account, use the [New Relic APM Errors page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-explore-events-behind-errors) and the [New Relic APM Databases page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/databases-page-view-operations-throughput-response-time), and [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/get-started-log-management) to search for the relevant queries.
1. For quick remediation, you can temporarily request the `max_allowed_packet` size to be increased when you [submit a ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket), but this is at the discretion of the Customer Engineering team, as too large of a value can cause replication failures by causing network congestion.
1. As a best practice, you should run the following command in your CLI for some of your large database tables:
   ```clike
   show table status like [table name to match]
   ```
   Evaluate the queries running on these tables to determine if you are exceeding the recommended `max_allowed_packet` size of 16MB. Follow the same process in step one to reduce the data being returned by such queries.
