This article provides the solution for the issue with cached images not being displayed after upgrading from Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.2.X to 2.3.X.

## Affected versions and editions:

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure Pro plan architecture 2.2.X, 2.3.X

## Issue

After Adobe Commerce is upgraded from 2.2.X to 2.3.X, the cached product images are not available, and a 404 page is displayed instead.

The issue is caused by the incorrect Nginx configuration set in `.magento.app.yaml`: `index.php` (or none) is used for the `"/media"` location instead of `passthru: /get.php`.

## Solution

1. Check your `.magento.app.yaml` configuration file, at the `"/media"` location. The correct configuration looks like following:
   ```yaml
   "/media":
       root: "pub/media"
       allow: true
       scripts: false
       expires: 1y
       passthru: "/get.php"
   ```    
1. If `passthru` is not set to `"/get.php"` and `expires` is not set, take the following steps.
1. Correct the configuration file.
    * Starter Plan: correct the file yourself and push the changes.
    * Pro Plan:
    * Integration: correct the file yourself and push the changes.
    * Staging and Production: correct the file yourself, push the changes, and create an [Adobe Commerce Support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) to have it applied.

1. Enable Fastly image optimization in the Commerce Admin (Fastly must be configured prior), as described in <https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/cdn/fastly-image-optimization.html>.

If the configuration is correct, but you are still experiencing the issue, continue the investigation or contact [Adobe Commerce Support](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251).
