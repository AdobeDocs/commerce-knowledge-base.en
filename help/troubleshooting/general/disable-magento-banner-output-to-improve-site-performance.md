This article provides a fix for low site performance. Low site performance can be caused by the Adobe Commerce Banner module being enabled but not used. Disabling the module output can improve site performance. Review the article for resolution steps.

>If you use the Adobe Commerce Banner functionality, see the [High throughput AJAX requests cause poor performance](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039286472-High-throughput-AJAX-requests-cause-poor-performance) article in our support knowledge base for recommendations on how to avoid performance issues caused by excessive Ajax requests.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure v.2.x.x
* Adobe Commerce on-premises v.2.2.x and 2.3.x

## Issue

The Adobe Banner module is enabled, but not used.

To check if this is the case:

For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.2.x:

1. Log in to the Commerce Admin.
1. Navigate to **Content** > *Elements* > **Banners**.
1. If the grid displayed on this page is empty, you do not have any banners.

If you do not see the **Banners** option under **Content** > *Elements*, then this is not the case, and the recommendations from this article cannot be applied.

For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.3.x (the functionality was [renamed in v 2.3.x](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.3.0Commerce.html#banner-now-dynamic-block)):

1. Log in to the Commerce Admin.
1. Navigate to **Content** > *Elements >*  **Dynamic Blocks**.
1. If the grid displayed on this page is empty, you do not have any dynamic blocks (banners).

If you do not see the **Dynamic Blocks** option under **Content** > *Elements*, then this is not the case, and the recommendations from this article cannot be applied.

## Cause

When the Adobe Commerce Banner module is enabled, Adobe Commerce sends Ajax requests from the storefront to the server to get the banner information. These Ajax requests have a performance impact, especially in high-load (high-volume and high-traffic) conditions. If the functionality is not used, it is recommended that you disable the module output. It is not recommended to disable the module, because of the dependency issues.

## Solution

>![warning]
>
>We strongly recommend testing changes on [Staging/Integration environment](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043032152-Integration-Environment-enhancement-request-Pro-and-Starter) first, before applying it to Production. We also recommend having a recent backup before any manipulations.

1. Disable the Adobe Commerce Banner module output, as described in [Disable module output](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/config/disable-module-output.html) in our developer documentation. The module name you need to use is `Magento_Banner`.
1. Deploy your code. For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, deploy as described in the [Deploy your store](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/live/stage-prod-live.html) article in our developer documentation.
