This article provides a solution for when you run out of disk space and need to safely remove files. Before considering this action, review [Manage disk space](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/manage-disk-space.html#no-space-left) in our developer documentation. If the steps in that article are not appropriate for you or do not solve the issue, review the steps in this article.


## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure:
  2.3.0-2.3.7, 2.4.0-2.4.2-p1
* This is specific to dedicated Pro clusters. Starter and Integration environments are single node, and do not have the `/data/exports` directory.

## Signs of low disk space

Signs you are running out of disk space can be stuck deployment, disk full warnings, and poor performance.
To see the amount of disk space used by the file system run the following command in the CLI/Terminal:

`df -h`


## How to safely delete files to increase disk space

Merchants can delete files from the application's mount points and through `/mnt/shared`. They are two different ways to access the same files.

**Never modify or delete the contents of `/data/exports`**. The files there should be accessed only through your applicationâ€™s mount points, so from your `/app` path or through `/mnt/shared`.

`/data/exports` is the underlying storage behind the shared filesystem, and it is managed by GlusterFS. The filesystem there contains not only the file contents, but metadata about the state of the filesystem to allow for synchronization between the nodes of your cluster. **Changing or deleting files directly within this filesystem will corrupt the shared filesystem, requiring extensive repairs or data recovery.**
