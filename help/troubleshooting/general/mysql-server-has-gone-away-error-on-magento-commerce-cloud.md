## Cause

The `default_socket_timeout` value is set too low. This is caused by the setting `default_socket_timeout` . If php doesn't receive anything from the MySQL database within this period, it assumes it is disconnected and throws the error.

## Solution

1. Check the current timeout period for `default_socket_timeout` by running in the CLI:    ```clike    php -i |grep default_socket_timeout    ```    
1. Depending on the timeout setting increase, the `default_socket_timeout` variable to the expected longest possible run time in the `/etc/platform/<project_name>/php.ini` file. It is suggested that you set between 10-15 mins.
1. Commit it to GIT and redeploy.
