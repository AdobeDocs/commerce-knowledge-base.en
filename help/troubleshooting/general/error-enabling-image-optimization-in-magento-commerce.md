This article provides a solution for the issue when Fastly Image Optimization (IO) is disabled by default with a notification to contact Fastly to enable image optimization. (The Fastly Cloud Image Optimizer is a real-time image manipulation and optimization service that speeds up image delivery by serving bandwidth-efficient images.)

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.2.x, 2.3.x

## Issue

On the Fastly Configuration page, next to the Fastly IO Snippet, you see the Current state: \_disabled \_with the following message underneath: Please contact your sales rep or send an email to [support@fastly.com](mailto:support@fastly) to request image optimization activation for your Fastly service.

## Cause

The site may not be live yet. There are processes in place to pre-load the site when it goes live in the Fastly database.

## Solution

Create a [Support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) and request image optimization.
