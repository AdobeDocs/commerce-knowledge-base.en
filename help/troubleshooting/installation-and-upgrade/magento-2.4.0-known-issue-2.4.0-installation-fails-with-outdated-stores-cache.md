This article provides a solution for the issue where your Adobe Commerce 2.4.0 installation fails with the error message: *The default website isn't defined. Set the website and try again.* displayed in the console.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.4.0
* Adobe Commerce on-premises 2.4.0

## Issue

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Prerequisites:</span>
A third-party extension with dependencies on APIs for the Store module in CLI commands is configured as required in `composer.json`. This causes the installation of Adobe Commerce 2.4.0 to fail with an error message: *The default website isn't defined. Set the website and try again.* displayed in the console.

## Cause

The issue appears for the third-party extensions which have dependencies on stores in their CLI commands. One is Amazon Sales Channels.

## Solution

Before the installation of Adobe Commerce 2.4.0, merchants have to:

1. Remove these third-party extensions from `composer.json`.
1. Install Adobe Commerce without extensions.
1. Add the extensions after the installation.

The issue will be fixed in the scope of 2.4.1 release.
