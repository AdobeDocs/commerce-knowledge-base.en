# [!DNL Live Search] facets are not alphabetically sorted

All [!DNL Commerce] storefront facets are sorted alphabetically with single-select options, regardless of the input type that is assigned to the corresponding attribute.

However, in certain edge cases, facets might not sort alphabetically as set up in the Admin. As a work-around, you can sort product attributes in the Admin attributes section.

1. On the *Admin* sidebar, go to **Stores** > *Attributes* > **Product**.
1. Select an attribute from the table.

1. Under **Manage Options**, you can sort the attribute values.
