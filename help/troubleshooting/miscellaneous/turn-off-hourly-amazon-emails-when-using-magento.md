## Question

I receive an email from Amazon every hour. Is the module doing this?

## Answer

Yes, in order to keep the systems continuously syncing, Adobe Commerce fetches reports from Amazon and reconciles the information against your Adobe Commerce catalog, and sends you notification emails based on these reports every hour. You have the ability to opt out of these notification report emails if you choose.

## To opt out of these emails:

Follow these instructions for [Updating Notification Preferences on Amazon's site](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G871).
