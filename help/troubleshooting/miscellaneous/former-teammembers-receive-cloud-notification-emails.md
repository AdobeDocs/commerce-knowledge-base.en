# Former team members receive Adobe Commerce Cloud notification emails

This article provides a solution for where team members that are no longer associated with your project receive notifications.

## Issue

A notice of a detected outage or important issue regarding the Cloud project/environment has been sent to your team. This includes members that may no longer be associated with your project. You want these people to stop receiving notifications.

## Solution

There are two ways to stop the notifications:

* Method 1: Using the Cloud Project URL. Refer to [Manage user access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access.html) in the Commerce on Cloud infrastructure guide for steps.  
* Method 2: Using the magento-cloud CLI. Refer to [Manage users with the CLI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access.html#manage-users-with-the-cli) in the Commerce on Cloud infrastructure guide for steps.
