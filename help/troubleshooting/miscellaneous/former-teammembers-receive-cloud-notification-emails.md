# Former team members receive Adobe Commerce cloud notification emails

This article provides a solution for where team members that are no longer associated with your project continue to receive notifications.

## Issue

A notice of a detected outage or important issue regarding the cloud project/environment has been sent to your team. This includes members that may no longer be associated with your project. You want these users to stop receiving notifications.

## Solution

There are two ways to stop the notifications by removing the user(s) from your project:

* Method 1: Using the cloud [!DNL Project URL]. Refer to [Manage user access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access.html) in the Commerce on cloud infrastructure guide for steps.  
* Method 2: Using the magento-cloud [!DNL CLI]. Refer to [Manage users with the [!DNL CLI]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access.html#manage-users-with-the-cli) in the Commerce on cloud infrastructure guide for steps.
