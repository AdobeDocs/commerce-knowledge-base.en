# Shared access troubleshooting

## I do not see the [!UICONTROL Shared Access] tab on my Commerce Account page (Account Owner)

 **Problem:** You want to provide shared access to your trusted colleague, but you cannot locate the **[!UICONTROL Shared Access]** tab on your Commerce Account page.

 **Possible cause:** Permissions, necessary to grant shared access, have not been associated with your Commerce Account.

 **Solution:** If you are the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder), contact your Adobe Account Team or [create a support ticket](/help/help-center-guide/help-center/magento-help-center-user-guide.md#merchant-not-displayed). Please specify your name and the email associated with your account.

 >[!NOTE]
 >
 >It is possible for even a non-Account Owner to have the [!UICONTROL Shared Access] tab on their account. However, only the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder) with the according privileges can provide shared access to other users. For more information on shared access, visit [Adobe Commerce Help Center User Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide.html?lang=en#who-can-provide-shared-access).

## I used shared access but cannot gain access to a particular resource

 **Problem:** I switched to the Shared Access account but cannot access the **[!UICONTROL Support tab]** (for example).

 **Possible cause:** The Support entitlements have expired or you have not been granted Shared Access to Support.

 **Solution:** 

 1. Switch back to **[!UICONTROL My Account]**. 
 1. Then click on the **[!UICONTROL Shared with me]** tab. 
 1. Click on the **[!UICONTROL Shared Access]** that you are having issues with and examine which resources you have been granted to.
 1. If the specific resource is missing, reach out to the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder).

 If you continue to face issues, contact your Adobe Account Team or send an email to [grp-Magento-HelpCenterLoginIssues@adobe.com](grp-Magento-HelpCenterLoginIssues@adobe.com) Please specify your name and the email associated with your Account.

## I used shared access but still see my tickets instead of the shared ones

 **Problem:** I'm accessing Help Center using shared access but still see only the tickets belonging to my own account (organization). The Commerce Account page shows I'm using the account of the organization that has provided shared access for me, but the organization tickets are still not showing.

 **Possible cause:** Your browser is using the cached content from the Help Center.

 **Solution:** Clear your browser cache and access the Help Center again (make sure you have switched to shared access on your Commerce Account page).
