# Shared access troubleshooting

## I do not see the [!UICONTROL Shared Access] tab on my Commerce Account page (Account Owner)

 **Problem:** You want to provide shared access to your trusted colleague, but you cannot locate the **[!UICONTROL Shared Access]** tab on your Commerce Account page.

 **Possible cause:** Permissions necessary to grant shared access have not been associated with your Commerce Account.

 **Solution:** 

 * If you are the account owner (primary account holder), contact your Adobe account Team. If your team member has access to Support, have them [create a support ticket](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#merchant-not-displayed). Specify the name and email associated with your account.
* If you are not the account owner, you must contact them to provide shared access and the necessary privileges.
* If the account owner is no longer with the company and you wish to transfer the account to another user, refer to [Transfer a Commerce account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/commerce-account/commerce-account-transfer).

 >[!NOTE]
 >
 >It is possible even for a non-account owner to have the [!UICONTROL Shared Access] tab on their account. However, only the account owner (primary account holder) with the necessary privileges can provide shared access to other users. For more information on shared access, refer to [Shared Access: Grant privileges for other users to access your account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#shared-access) in Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

## I used shared access but cannot gain access to a particular resource

 **Problem:** I switched to the [UICONTROL Shared Access] account but cannot access the **[!UICONTROL Support tab]** (for example).

 **Possible cause:** The support entitlements have expired, or you have not been granted shared access to support.

 **Solution:** 

 1. Switch back to **[!UICONTROL My Account]**.
 1. Click on the **[!UICONTROL Shared with me]** tab.
 1. Click on the **[!UICONTROL Shared Access]** account that you are having issues with and examine which resources you have been granted access to.
 1. If the specific resource is missing, reach out to the account owner (primary account holder).
 
 If you continue to face issues, contact your Adobe account team. Specify the name and email associated with your account.

## I used shared access and clicked on [!UICONTROL Support], but when I opened a new ticket for the organization, there was no product available in the form

 **Problem:** I cannot select the appropriate Cloud Project when opening a ticket on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home?lang=en#support).

 **Possible cause:** You may not have been added to the project, or the project is associated with a different license (some organizations may have subsidiaries/related companies with very similar names).

 **Solution:** 

 1. Make sure that you have been added to the project. See [Manage user access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access). 
 1. Ensure that you have been given shared access by the account owner to the license associated with the project.

 If you continue to face issues, contact your Adobe account team. Specify the name and email associated with your account.

## I used shared access and clicked on [!UICONTROL Support], but when I opened a new ticket for the organization that has the Commerce entitlements, the cloud project was not listed in the form

 **Problem**: I cannot select the appropriate Cloud Project when opening a ticket on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support).

 **Possible cause**: You may not have been added to the project, or the project is associated with a different license (some organizations may have subsidiaries/related companies with very similar names).

 **Solution**:

 1. Make sure that you have been added to the project. See [Manage user access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/project/user-access).
 1. Ensure you have been given shared access by the account owner to the license associated with the project.

 If you continue to face issues, contact your Adobe account team. Specify the name and email associated with your account.

## I used shared access and clicked on [!UICONTROL Support], but when I opened a new ticket, the [!UICONTROL Organization] dropdown was not displayed or didn't list that organization

 **Problem**: I switched to the [!UICONTROL Shared Access] account, but when I try to submit a ticket on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), no organization is available, or the organization name isn't listed in the dropdown.

 **Possible cause**: You have only been granted shared access to one merchant in your account.

 **Solution**: 

 1. Switch back to **[!UICONTROL My Account]**.
 1. If it lists only one shared name, that will be the default organization under which your tickets will be opened.
 
 If you continue to face issues, contact your Adobe Account Team. Specify the name and email associated with your account.

## I used shared access but still see my tickets instead of the shared ones

 **Problem:** I'm accessing [https://support.magento.com/hc/us-en/requests|Help Center] using shared access but still see only the tickets belonging to my own account (organization). The Commerce Account page shows I'm using the organization's account, which has provided shared access for me, but the organization tickets are still not showing.

 **Possible cause:** Your browser is using the cached content from the Help Center.

 **Solution:** Clear your browser cache and access the Help Center again (make sure you have switched to shared access on your Commerce Account page).
