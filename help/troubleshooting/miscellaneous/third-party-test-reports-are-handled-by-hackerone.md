# Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans should go to HackerOne

This article provides solution on what you should do about vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce (all versions)

## Issues

Merchant performed PEN test through an independent security agency and a vulnerability is flagged.

## Solutions

Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans should be sent to the HackerOne website. Adobe Commerce does not have a direct point of contact at HackerOne, so users should directly reach out to HackerOne. Adobe only handles MST(Magento security scan tool) report.
