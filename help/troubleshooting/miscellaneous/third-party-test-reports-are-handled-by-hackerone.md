# Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans should go to [!DNL HackerOne]

This article provides a solution to address vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce (all versions)

## Issues

Merchant performed PEN test through an independent security agency and a vulnerability is flagged.

## Solutions

Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans should be sent to the [!DNL HackerOne] website. Adobe Commerce does not have a direct point of contact at [!DNL HackerOne], so you should directly reach out to [!DNL HackerOne]. Adobe only handles the MST (Magento Security Scan tool) report.
