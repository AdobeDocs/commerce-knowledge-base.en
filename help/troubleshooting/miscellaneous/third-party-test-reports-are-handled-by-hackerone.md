# Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans need to go via HackerOne

This article offers clarification on what users should do about vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce (all versions)

## Issues

Merchant performed PEN test and reviewed high-risk items.


## Solutions


Vulnerabilities found by third-party security scans should be sent to the HackerOne website. Adobe Commerce does not have a direct point of contact at HackerOne, so users should directly reach out to HackerOne. 

Only MST( Magento security scan tool) report will be taken care by Adobe.
