# Error **Could not acquire lock for cron job: indexer_update_all_views**

This article provides a workaround for the issue when your site has performance issues caused by constant reindexing. This is caused by the CRON Job `indexer_reindex_all_invalid` continously running (and processing) and caches are cleaned on reindex.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises x.x.x
* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure x.x.x

(*Alternatively if the same versions on cloud or on-premises are affected you can say:*)

Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) x.x.x

* Affected extension or technology (e.g. Redis, Fastly): x.x.x

## Issue

In New Relic > **Logs** > **Attributes** > apmApplicationNames >[Your APM aplication name] you see the following error message about the `indexer_update_all_views`cron:
**[timestamp] report.Warning. Could not acquire lock for cron job: indexer_update_all_views [] []**

There are many other crons jobs that are pending and in an error state.

You can also see in **System** > **Tools** > **Index Management** many indexes are in an **IDLE** state.

## Cause

When the core Adobe Commerce importer is run (manually or by CRON) then a set of plugins across multiple core modules are executed to determine what indexes should be invalidated.

The issue occurs when the Category Permissions module is enabled in Commerce Admin, if this is true then the moduleâ€™s plugin always invalidates the Product & Category indexes (and linked indexes) when an import is executed. If the standard import types are examined they they all affect Category Permissions and so the invalidation is expected.

In addition, when a site has the B2B modules enabled if Shared Catalog is activated it turns on and locks Category Permissions. Turning off Shared Catalog will unlock Category Permissions but not switch off.

This is the code that invalidates the indexes:

`Magento\CatalogPermissions\Model\Indexer\Plugin\Import`

```php
public function afterImportSource(\Magento\ImportExport\Model\Import $subject, $import)
{
    if ($this->config->isEnabled()) {
        $this->indexerRegistry->get(\Magento\CatalogPermissions\Model\Indexer\Category::INDEXER_ID)->invalidate();
        $this->indexerRegistry->get(\Magento\CatalogPermissions\Model\Indexer\Product::INDEXER_ID)->invalidate();
    }
    return $import;
}
```

## Solution

Write custom import modules that use the core Commerce importer as a base and do not import data that affects Category Permissions.
