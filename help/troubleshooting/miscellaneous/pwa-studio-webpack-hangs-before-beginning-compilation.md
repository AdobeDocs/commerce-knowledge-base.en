This article talks about a suggested solution to when a javascript [Webpack](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/tools-libraries/#webpack) hangs for a long time before beginning compilation in Progressive Web App Studio (PWA Studio).

## Affected products and versions

* PWA Studio

## Issue

[Check what the latest release of the pwa-buildpack is](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/tree/master/packages/pwa-buildpack), and the

```yaml
pwa-buildpack
```

version number will be next to the `package.json` filename listing. If you have an old version of the

```yaml
pwa-buildpack
```

project, the webpack may hang for a long time before beginning compilation.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

<ins>Prerequisites</ins>: Set up a PWA Studio storefront, such as Venia, with a local Adobe Commerce instance and run a

```yaml
build
```

or

```yaml
watch
```

command.

<ins>Expected result</ins>:

* If using the    ```yaml    build    ```    command, it generates the build artifacts for Venia normally.
* If using the    ```yaml    watch    ```    command, it starts the Venia storefront normally.

<ins>Actual result</ins>:

Your

```yaml
build
```

or

```yaml
watch
```

command will seem stalled and will not complete, nor will any errors be shown.

## Solutions

Update your project using the following command:

```yaml
yarn upgrade
```

Make sure you have a current version of openssl on your system using the following command:

```yaml
openssl version
```

The version should be 1.0 or above (or LibreSSL 2, in the case of OSX High Sierra.).

You can install higher versions of OpenSSL with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on OSX, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows, or your Linux distributionâ€™s package manager.
