# General custom module troubleshooting help

This article talks about general tools to help in troubleshooting custom modules in Adobe Commerce.

## Issue

If you realize there is an issue with the features from your custom module, and you get no obvious error messages that state the issue, then you will want to consult your instance's logs.

## Solution

Check the logs to see if there are entries with custom module's name in the error.  Depending on the errors involved, the solution may present itself, or you may need to include your helpful Adobe Commerce log information if you want to open a [Support Ticket](/help/help-center-guide/help-center/magento-help-center-user-guide.md#submit-ticket). See the following paragraphs for the info about logs' location and possible solutions.
