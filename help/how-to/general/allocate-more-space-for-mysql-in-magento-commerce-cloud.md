This article provide instructions on how to allocate more space for MySQL in Adode Commerce on cloud infrastructure.

## Allocate space on Starter plan and Pro plan Integration

For all Starter plan environments and Pro plan [Integration environment](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043032152-Integration-Environment-enhancement-request-Pro-and-Starter), you can allocate more space for MySQL in the `.magento/services.yaml` file, by increasing the `mysql: disk:` parameter. For example:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.0
    disk: 2048
```

See the [Set up MySQL service](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/project-conf-files_services-mysql.html) article for reference.

Once you change the `.magento/services.yaml` file, you need to commit and push your changes, for them to be applied. The push will trigger the deployment process.

>A Starter plan partition should never be made smaller (for example, going from 30GB to 20GB) as this will likely result in catastrophic data corruption.

## Allocate space on Pro plan Staging or Production

To make these changes for the Staging or Production environment of the Pro plan, you must create a [support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket). When submitting a support ticket to increase storage, support will need to know how much and to what partition the storage should be applied to (`/mysql` or `/exports`). A storage increase request requires approval from your Customer Success Manager, who will review your entitled amount of storage (as per the order form) before approving.

## Decreasing allocated space not available (Pro and Starter plan)

Adobe Commerce Support can grow a partition (`/mysql` or `/exports`), but cannot shrink a partition. There is risk of data corruption in doing so, that is why decreasing storage for a partition isnâ€™t available.
It is also true for the Starter plan, where you can increase the allocated space yourself: decreasing is highly not recommended and might result in catastrophic data corruption.
