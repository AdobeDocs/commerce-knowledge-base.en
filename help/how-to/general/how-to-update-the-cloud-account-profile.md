# How to update the cloud account profile

This article provides steps on how to modify the profile on the cloud account.

## Solution

When modifying a profile on the cloud account, the following fields can be modified:

1. [!UICONTROL First name]
1. [!UICONTROL Last name]
1. [!UICONTROL Username]

To modify these fields, follow these steps:

1. Access your account at [Adobe account login](https://accounts.magento.cloud).
1. Click on the **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]** tab.
1. Select the *create new password* checkbox.
1. Make the necessary changes and click *save*.

**NOTE**: *Your password will not be changed.*

## What cannot be modified?

1. **[!UICONTROL Password]**:
To change your password, visit [Adobe password reset](https://account.adobe.com/), as this profile is linked to your account/email address there.

1. **[!UICONTROL Email Address]**:
Modifying this field depends on your individual circumstances.

If you need to transfer ownership of your current account to a new owner or a different email address, you will need to update the primary user email associated with the account.
