## Cause
In Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.4 and 2.4.5, the application is designed to use `elasticsearch7` as the default search engine, as OpenSearch is not fully supported as a selectable option in these versions.

Starting from version 2.4.6, Adobe Commerce, in non-Cloud environments, allows configuring the search engine via the Admin Panel. However, in Cloud environments, the search engine is locked and controlled through configuration files.
