# How to obtain and apply security patches

Explore what to do when a new security patch has been released but you have not been provided instructions on how to obtain the patch and apply it.

## Affected products and versions 

All versions- OnPremise and Cloud

## Cause

Most security patch releases do not come with a physical file/hotfix to be applied.

## Solution

If a physical patch file/hotfix was mentioned in the Release Notes:

* You can download the file from the download section of [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login). (Shared access users must first be given download privileges by the account owner/license holder) 

If a physical patch file/hotfix was not mentioned in the Release Notes:

* **Cloud:**

1. Some Security Patches might be included/released in the latest version of Cloud Tools Suite (ECE Tools) under Cloud Patches for Commerce - check the [Release Notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/release-notes/cloud-tools-suite), and if a security fix is mentioned in the release, upgrade the package to that version.
   
1. If the Release Notes do not mention a security fix, continue reading.

* **Cloud or On-Premise:**

If a physical patch file/hotfix is not available, you must [upgrade your Commerce version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/develop/upgrade/commerce-version) 2.4.X to the latest patch version 2.4.X-pY.
