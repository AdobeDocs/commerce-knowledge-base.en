In the Visual Report Builder, there are global Time Range and Interval settings that allow you to analyze the data in your report for a **specific time period** . In some cases, however, you may want to analyze **different** Time Ranges or Time Intervals in the same report. Thatâ€™s where Time Options come in.

In this video, you'll learn:

* How to use independent Time Options
* How to compare the **same** metric across **different** Time Ranges

 **Want some more examples?** Check out our [Using Time Options in the Visual Report Builder tutorial](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016505432) for written instructions and sample use-cases.
