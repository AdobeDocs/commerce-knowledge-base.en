Learn how to solve error that occurs while setting the search engine to OpenSearch that falls back to Elasticsearch7

# Elasticsearch7 is shown as the search engine despite OpenSearch installation 

This article provides a solution for the issue where Elasticsearch7 is still shown as the search engine for Adobe Commerce on cloud eventhough your version support OpenSearch.

# Description

## Environment

### Affected products and versions
2.4.4-2.4.5 on Adobe Commerce Cloud

## Issue Description
Even though your version does support OpenSearch, the application will only recognize/accept Elasticsearch7 as the search engine.

From the version 2.4.6, the application was updated to allow OpenSearch to be selected/specified as the search engine.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog Search**.
2. Open it in a *non-Cloud environment*
> [!NOTE]
> If you open it in a Cloud environment, this field cannot be changed because the search engine is locked in the app/etc/env.php file.

# Resolution

Update the *SEARCH_CONFIGURATION* variable in the **.magento.env.yaml** file and ensure that the engine is set to **Elasticsearch7**.
