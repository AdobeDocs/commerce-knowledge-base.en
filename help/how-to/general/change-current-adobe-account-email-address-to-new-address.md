This article explains how to change the current email address registered on the [Adobe Account](https://account.adobe.com/) to a new address currently not registered on [Adobe Account](https://account.adobe.com/) or [Magento Account](https://account.magento.com/).

## Affected products and versions

Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods and versions)

## Issue

How to change your Adobe account's email address (e.g., current@email.com) to a new address (e.g., new@myemail.com) that is currently not registered in [Adobe account](https://account.adobe.com/) or [Magento account](https://account.magento.com/).

<u>Prerequisites</u>

The owner of the new email address must have access to the current email address.
