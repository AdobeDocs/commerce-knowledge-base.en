For your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure project, you may change the New Relic account owner on the New Relic UI page. For detailed steps, see [Change the account Owner](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/change-account-owner) in New Relic documentation.

If the user (that you want to assign the owner role to) is not listed on your account yet, you will need to add the user to the account. See [Add and update users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-update-users) in New Relic documentation, in particular the [Add a new user](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-update-users#adding_users) section.

If someone needs to be added as a user, but no existing Owner or Admin on the account can help them, any Adobe Commerce user who has access to the New Relic's [Adobe Commerce Partnership Owner Account](https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/1311131/users) is able to view all Customer accounts and add users on the Customer's behalf.
