# How to change email address on magento.com account when the field is grayed out?

This article explains how to change the email address on your [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) account when the field is grayed out under circumstances such as:
- You or the original user has left the company
- Your company has migrated to a new email domain
- Switching to a Distribution List or catch-all email address

## Affected products and versions

* All Adobe Commerce versions and infrastructure types

## Cause

The email address on your [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) account is linked to your Adobe account at <https://account.adobe.com> and will have to be updated there.

## Steps to change the email address

### Case I:

Changing the email address for a user who has their own account at <https://account.adobe.com>

<u>Solution</u>

1. [Submit a support request](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support) at https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support stating the following:

    * Existing email address to be updated
    * New email address
    * MAGE ID of the new account (if available)

1. Request the team to merge both accounts in order to update the email address on the existing account.

### Case II:

Changing the email address for a user who currently does not have their own account at <https://account.adobe.com> 

<u>Solution</u>

If you have access to the mailbox of the [current owner email], reset the password for the current owner's email following the [Reset or change your Adobe password](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/change-or-reset-password.html) guide in the Creative Cloud User Guide.

1. Locate the password reset link sent to the current owner's mailbox with instructions.
1. Set a new password, and change the email to [new owner email].
1. Navigate to the [IMS Account](https://account.adobe.com/) to log in with the new email, and change the password.
1. After changing the email address and password, navigate to [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) to log in using the [new owner email].

However, if you don't have access to emails sent to the [current owner email], follow these steps:

1. Set up email forwarding from the [current owner email] to a new email using your company's mail server configuration. 
1. Now proceed with the preceding steps.
