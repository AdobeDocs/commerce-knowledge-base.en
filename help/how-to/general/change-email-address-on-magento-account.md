# How to change email address on magento.com account when the field is grayed out

This article explains how to modify the email address on your [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) account when the field is grayed out.

## Affected products and versions

* All Adobe Commerce versions and infrastructure types

## Cause

The email address on your [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) account is linked to your Adobe account at <https://account.adobe.com> and will have to be updated there.

## Steps to change the email address

### Case I:

Changing the email address for a user who has their own account at <https://account.adobe.com>

<u>Solution</u>

Send an email to Grp-magento-HelpCenterLoginIssues@adobe.com requesting to merge the accounts.

### Case II:

Changing the email address for a user who currently does not have their own account at <https://account.adobe.com>

<u>Solution</u>

If you have access to the mailbox of the [Current Owner email], please reset the password for [Current Owner email] following the [instructions here](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/change-or-reset-password.html).

1. Locate the password reset link sent to the Current Owner's mailbox with instructions.
1. Set a new password and change the email to [New Owner email].
1. Navigate to the [IMS Account](https://account.adobe.com/) to log in with the new email and set up the password.
1. After changing the email address and password, navigate to [Magento.com](https://account.magento.com) to log in using the [New Owner email].

However, if you don't have access to emails sent to [Current Owner email], follow these steps:

1. Set up email forwarding from the [Current Owner email] to a new email using your company's mail server configuration. 
1. Now proceed with the preceding steps.
