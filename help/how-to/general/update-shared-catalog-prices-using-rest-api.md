To add or update prices in Shared Catalogs with API, we recommend using the `TierPriceStorageInterface` service, described in the [Manage tier prices](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/rest/modules/catalog-pricing.html#manage-tier-prices) REST API Reference in our developer documentation. For Shared Catalog prices, we use Tier Price and Customer Group.
