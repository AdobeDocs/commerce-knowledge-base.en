## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, Pro plan architecture.

## Issue

You will receive an alert in New Relic if you have signed up to [Managed alerts for Adobe Commerce](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045806832) and one or more of the alert thresholds have been surpassed. These alerts were developed by Adobe to give customers a standard set using insights from Support and Engineering.

 <ins> **Do!** </ins>

* Abort any deployment scheduled until this alert is cleared.
* Put your site into maintenance mode immediately if your site is or becomes completely unresponsive. For steps refer to [Installation Guide > Enable or disable maintenance mode](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-subcommands-maint.html?itm_source=devdocs&itm_medium=search_page&itm_campaign=federated_search&itm_term=mainten) in our developer documentation. Make sure to add your IP to the exempt IP address list to ensure that you are still able to access your site for troubleshooting. For steps, refer to [Maintain the list of exempt IP addresses](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-subcommands-maint.html?itm_source=devdocs&itm_medium=search_page&itm_campaign=federated_search&itm_term=mainten#instgde-cli-maint-exempt) in our developer documentation.

 <ins> **Don't!** </ins>

* Launch additional marketing campaigns which may bring additional page views to your site.
* Run indexers or additional crons which may cause additional stress on CPU or disk.
* Do any major administrative tasks (i.e., Commerce Admin, data imports/exports).
* Clear your cache. Your site may become non-responsive, (if you are not already experiencing a site outage) if you do any of the "Don't" actions before you have investigated and solved the cause of the alert.

## Solution

Follow these steps to identify and troubleshoot the cause:

1. In New Relic, review disks for highest use. For steps refer to Storage tab on New Relic [Infrastructure monitoring Hosts page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui/infrastructure-hosts-page):
    * If in New Relic you see a slow increase in disk usage, try the following options:
    * Optimizing disk space by adjusting space allocation. For steps, refer to [Manage Disk space](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/manage-disk-space.html) in our developer documentation. You may also need to request more disk space (contact your CSM).
    * Clear up disk space for MySQL. Refer to [MySQL disk space is low](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037591972) for steps.
    * If New Relic shows rapidly increasing disk usage, this could indicate that there is a problem that has caused a file to increase very quickly in a directory. Do the following checks:
1. Check overall disk space to identify the problem by running the following command in the CLI/Terminal: `df -h`   
1. After you identify a directory with unexpectedly large and increasing disk usage, you need to check the affected file system. The following example shows how to check the file directory `pub/media/`. This is the directory Adobe Commerce uses for storing logs and big media files. However, you should run this command for any directory that shows unexpected disk usage: `du -sch ~/pub/media/*`.

If the output from the terminal shows a file in one of these directories rapidly increasing in disk usage and you know that the file's content is not needed, consider removing the file. If you are not comfortable taking this action, [submit an Adobe Commerce support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251).
