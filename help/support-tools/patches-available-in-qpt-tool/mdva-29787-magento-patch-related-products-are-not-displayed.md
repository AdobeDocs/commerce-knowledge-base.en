## Issue

The target rule for **Related Products** does not work when "*is one of*" condition is used for **Products to Display** in the Commerce Admin.

>![info]
>
>Note:â€¯This patch does not fix existing target rules. You must re-create existing target rules.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Create **New Attribute** (Example: Test\_Attr).
    * Set **Catalog Input Type for Store Owner** = *Text.*
    * In **Storefront Properties**, set **Use for Promo Rule Conditions** = *Yes*.
1. Create **New Attribute Set** (Example: Test\_Set).
1. Add the **New Attribute** to the **New Attribute Set** (Example: Add "Test\_Attr" attribute to the "Test\_Set" attribute set).
1. Create three products. For the Example, they are set like this:
    * Product1, Test\_Attr = MAGT2NA\_Test3
    * Product2, Test\_Attr = 24-MB02
    * Product3, Test\_Attr = 701644329389M
1. Create target **Rule** (**Marketing**   > **Related Product Rules** and click the **Add Rule** button.) with settings:
    * **Apply To** = *Related Products*
    * **Products to Match**
    * Set the New Attribute you created **in** **Step 1 above** to be the Product1's attribute (Example: Test\_Attr = MAGT2NA\_Test3).
    * **Products to Display** = The attributes of the other two products (Example: 24-MB02 and 701644329389M attributes).
1. Save the **Rule**.
1. Run a reindex, if needed.
1. Clear cache.
1. Open Product1 on the frontend.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The related products are present.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:
