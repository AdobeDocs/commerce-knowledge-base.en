## Issue

Sitemaps generated by cron in Adobe Commerce contain the wrong image URL path.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. In the Commerce Admin, create a new website, store, or store view.
1. Add at least one product to each store, and add at least one image to each product.
1. Enable **Sitemap Generation By Schedule** in **Admin** > **Stores** > **Configuration** > **CATALOG** > **XML Sitemap** > **Generation Settings**.
1. Generate a sitemap for any of the two stores manually in **Admin** > **Marketing** > **Site Map** using a sitemap name like "*sitemap.xml*".
    * Rename the file to something like "*manual\_sitemap.xml*" or copy the file content to any text editor.
1. Generate the same sitemap by cron job `sitemap_generate`.
1. Compare the manually generated sitemap "*manual\_sitemap.xml*" and the sitemap generated by cron "*sitemap.xml*".

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The cached sitemap image path URL is correct.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

The sitemap generated by cron contains the wrong image path URL. If you try to open the image from "*sitemap.xml*", it will show a default placeholder. Manually generated sitemap URLs are unaffected by this issue.
