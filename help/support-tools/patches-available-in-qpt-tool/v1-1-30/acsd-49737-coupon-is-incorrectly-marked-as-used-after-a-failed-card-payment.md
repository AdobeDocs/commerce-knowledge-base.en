## Issue

Coupon is incorrectly marked as used after a failed card payment.

Configure **[!UICONTROL Braintree sandbox payment]** method.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** with auto generated coupon codes. 
1. Login as a customer.
1. Add product(s) to cart.
1. Apply an **[!UICONTROL auto generated coupon code]**.
1. Try to place the order with a failed payment.
1. Execute **[!DNL bin/magento cron:run] command, which will start the **[!UICONTROL "sales.rule.update.coupon.usage]** to the consumer.
1. Check the coupon usage in the Cart Price Rule under **[!UICONTROL Manage Coupon Codes]** tab.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Coupon shouldn't be flagged as "used" if the payment is failed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

1. Coupon code says used: Yes, Times Used: 1
1. Coupon code cannot be applied again, since it's for a single time use.
