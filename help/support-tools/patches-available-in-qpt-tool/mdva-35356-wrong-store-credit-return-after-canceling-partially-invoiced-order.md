## Issue

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Create three simple products.
1. Create a new user and assign store credit (Example: store credit = *$10,* simple product prices = *$100*, *$200*, and *$300*).
1. Log in with the above user, and add the three products to the cart.
1. Check out the three products in the cart, and utilize the store credit for a portion of the order (Example: paid with **Check/Money order**).
1. Perform two invoices on the order through the API, one for Product 1 and one for Product 2:
    ```php    
    //endpoint POST {\{baseUrl}}/V1/order/:orderId/invoice    //1st API call:    {    "capture": true,    "items": [    {    "order_item_id": 1,    "qty": 1    }    ],    "notify": true,    "appendComment": false    }    //2nd API call:    {    "capture": true,    "items": [    {    "order_item_id": 2,    "qty": 1    }    ],    "notify": true,    "appendComment": false    }    
    ```    
1. Notice that the store credit is fully applied to the first invoice.
1. â€‹Notice that the store credit balance = *0*.
1. Cancel the order, and see that two items are invoiced and that the third item is canceled.
1. Observe the store credit balance.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The store credit balance is still 0 because the $10 store credit has been invoiced.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

The full store credit is returned: the balance is $10.
