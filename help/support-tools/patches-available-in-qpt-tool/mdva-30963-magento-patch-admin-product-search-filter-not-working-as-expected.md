This patch is available when the [Quality Patches Tool (QPT)](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047139492) 1.0.8 is installed. Please note that the issue was fixed in Adobe Commerce 2.4.2.

## Issue

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Set **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Price** > **Catalog Price Scope** = *Website*.
1. Create two websites having two different currencies (For example, the default website is an India Store \[Rupee â‚¹\], and the second one is the US Store \[Dollar $\]).
1. Set the following **Base Currency**, **Default Display Currency**, and **Allowed Currencies**:
    * **Default Config** = *US Dollar (Default)*
    * **Main Website** = *Indian Rupee*
    * **WebsiteUS** = **Use Default** = *US Dollar*
1. Set **Stores** > **Currency Rates** = *1:1*.
1. Create a test simple product assigned to both Websites with the following prices:
    * **Default Price** = **US Website price** = *123 USD*
    * **Main Website price** = *321 Rupee*
1. Create a subAdmin user that has access only to the US Store.
1. Go to the US storefront, and put a product in the cart (Example: *123 USD price*).
1. Log in to the Admin with subAdmin just created (Example: *US Only admin*).
1. Go to **Reports** > **Products in cart**.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

When filtering within the **All store view** store view scope, products filtering should get the value set in that particular scope.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

Values overridden in a store view scope are also considered when filtering on the "All store view" store view scope.
