## Issue

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Enable FPT.
1. Create an attribute (Example: *weee\_tax*).
1. Create a test product (Example: *weeetax*) with the *weee\_tax* attribute added.
1. Assign FPT to California or to another state on the *weee\_tax* attribute.
1. Create a customer in GraphQL.
1. Create a cart in GraphQL.
1. Add the *weetax* product to the cart with GraphQL.
1. Query the cart:

```php    
{cart(cart_id: "xxx") {    items {    id    product {    name    sku    price_range {    minimum_price {    final_price {    value    }    fixed_product_taxes {    label    amount {    value    }    }    }    maximum_price {    final_price {    value    }    fixed_product_taxes {    label    amount {    value    }    }    }    }    }    prices {    price {    value    }    }    quantity    }    prices {    subtotal_excluding_tax {    value    }    applied_taxes {    amount {    value    }    }    grand_total {    value    currency    }    discounts {    amount {    value    }    label    }    }}}    
```    

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The FPT would be populated normally, as expected.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

* The FPT does not populate with data and is empty.
* The cart query gives this response:

```php
{
 "data": {
 "cart": {
 "items": [
 {
 "id": "1",
 "product": {
 "name": "fpt",
 "sku": "fpt",
 "price_range": {
 "minimum_price": {
 "final_price": {
 "value": 10
 },
 "fixed_product_taxes": []
 },
 "maximum_price": {
 "final_price": {
 "value": 10
 },
 "fixed_product_taxes": []
 }
 }
 },
 "prices": {
 "price": {
 "value": 10
 }
 },
 "quantity": 1
 }
 ],
 "prices": {
 "subtotal_excluding_tax": {
 "value": 10
 },
 "applied_taxes": [],
 "grand_total": {
