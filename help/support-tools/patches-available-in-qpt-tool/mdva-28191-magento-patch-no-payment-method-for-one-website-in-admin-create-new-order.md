The MDVA-28191 patch fixes the issue where a payment method is not loading in the Admin **Create New Order** for one website, although payment methods may be showing for other websites.  This patch is available when the [Quality Patches Tool (QPT)](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047139492) tool version 1.0.5 is installed.

## Affected products and versions

Adobe Commerce on-premises and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.3.3 to 2.4.1 (including 2.3.5-p1).

>Note: the patch might become applicable to other versions with new Quality Patches Tool releases. To check if the patch is compatible with your Adobe Commerce version, update the `magento/quality-patches` package to the latest version and check the compatibility on the [QPT landing page](https://devdocs.magento.com/quality-patches/tool.html#patch-grid). Use the patch ID as a search keyword to locate the patch.

## Issue

When creating an order from the backend Adobe Commerce creates two quotes, one is inactive and the other is active. But the session holds the inactive quote id.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span>

1. Go to **Admin Panel** > **Sales** > **Orders** and click the **Create New Order** button.    
1. Choose the customer you want to create the order for.
1. If your store has multiple views, choose the store view where the order is to be placed, on the **Create New Order** page for the user you selected.
1. Add products from the **Customer's Activities** section or from the catalog by clicking **Add Products**. Scroll down the page to complete the following sections as needed for the order:
    * Apply Coupon Codes
    * Payment Method
    * Shipping Method
    * Order Comments

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected result:</span>

 Payment methods should be loaded in the Admin for all websites.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual result:</span>

No payment method available (neither is the message "*No Payment Information Required*" displayed) for this website, although payment methods may show when testing orders for other websites.
