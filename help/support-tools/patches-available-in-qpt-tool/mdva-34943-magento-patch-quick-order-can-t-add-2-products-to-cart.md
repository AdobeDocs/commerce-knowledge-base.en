## Issue

Users are unable to add two or more products to the cart in quick order.

<ins>Prerequisites</ins>:

Adobe Commerce with simple products.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Go to **Quick Order** on the Storefront (while not logged in).
1. Enter a valid SKU, click the product that shows up in the autocomplete field, and set **Quantity** = *1*.
1. Enter the same valid SKU, but change the case (change uppercase to lowercase, or change lowercase to uppercase) of the first character, and click the product that shows up in the autocomplete field, and set **Quantity** = *1*.
1. Enter a `random_sting_value` for **SKU**, and set **Quantity** = *1*.
1. Set **SKU** = *123123123*, and set **Quantity** = *1*.
1. Delete everything except the first entry you added to the **Quick Order** page.
1. Enter the 1st SKU (similar to Step 2 above) in the **Enter Multiple SKUs** field, and click **Add to List**.
1. This results in a quantity of 2 for the first SKU and a line for a `random_sting_value`.
1. To test more, refresh the page.
1. This results in no SKUs for quick order, as expected.
1. Enter a `random_sting_value2` into the **Enter Multiple SKUs** field, and click **Add to List**.
1. This results in two valid SKUs from before and a `random_sting_value2`.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

Two or more products are able to be added to the cart, as expected.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

When taken to the **Cart** page, the first added product appears normally, but for the second product and any subsequent products added to the cart, a "*1 product requires attention*" error message appears. The second or any additional products will be listed on the **Product Requires Attention** section of the **Cart** page.
