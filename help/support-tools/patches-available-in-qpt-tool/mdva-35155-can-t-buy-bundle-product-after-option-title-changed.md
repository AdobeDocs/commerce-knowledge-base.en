## Issue

Bundle products can't be bought after the option title is changed.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Create a new bundle product via **Product Import**.
1. The product is normal in both the Admin and frontend (in stock and can be added to the cart).
1. Update the same product with changes in the name in `bundle_values` and re-import the product.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The existing bundle option is updated to the new name and keeps the same items in it.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

* Admin attempts to merge products with the same SKU into a single bundle-option section, resulting in an empty option section.
* The product is out of stock on the frontend (even after a reindex).
