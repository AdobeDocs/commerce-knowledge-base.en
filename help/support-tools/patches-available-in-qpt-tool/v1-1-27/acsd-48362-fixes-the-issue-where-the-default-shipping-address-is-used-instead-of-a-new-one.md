## Issue

When a customer adds a new shipping address on the negotiable quote page, the checkout page still uses the default shipping address. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable B2B quote from Stores > Configuration > B2B features > Enable company > Enable B2B quote.
1. Log in as a company user account.
1. Add a product to the cart.
1. Go to the cart page and Request a Quote.
1. Go to the customer My Quotes page and select the quote that was just created.
1. In the customer quote page Shipping Information section, click Add New Address, fill out the form, and Save Address (do not select Use as my default billing address and Use as my default shipping address).
1. Click Send for Review on the customer quote page.
1. In Admin as an admin user open the Quote that was just created and click Send.
1. On the customer quote page, refresh and click Proceed to Checkout.
1. On the checkout page the new shipping address is selected but the data shows the default shipping address.
1. Continue and Place Order.

<u>Expected results</u>:
The order should use the new address without reselecting the shipping addresses on the checkout page.

<u>Actual results</u>:
The order is placed with the default shipping address.
