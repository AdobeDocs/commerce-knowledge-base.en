## Issue

When a customer adds a new shipping address on the negotiable quote page, the checkout page still uses the default shipping address. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable **[!UICONTROL B2B quote]** from **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B features]** > Enable company > Enable B2B quote.
1. Log in as a company user account.
1. Add a product to the cart.
1. Go to the cart page and **[!UICONTROL Request a Quote]**.
1. Go to the customer **[!UICONTROL My Quotes]** page and select the quote that was just created.
1. In the customer quote page **[!UICONTROL Shipping Information]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Add New Address]**, fill out the form, and Save Address (do not select **[!UICONTROL Use as my default billing address]** or **[!UICONTROL Use as my default shipping address]**).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send for Review]** on the customer quote page.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Admin]** as an admin user open the quote that was just created and click **[!UICONTROL Send]**.
1. On the customer quote page, refresh and click **[!UICONTROL Proceed to Checkout]**.
1. On the checkout page, data shows the default shipping address even when the new shipping address is selected.
1. Continue and click **[!UICONTROL Place Order]**.

<u>Expected results</u>:
The order should use the new address without reselecting the shipping addresses on the checkout page.

<u>Actual results</u>:
The order is placed with the default shipping address.
