## Issue

The store credit is applied multiple times during order placement.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Create a customer and add store credit to the customer account.
1. Add a simple product to the cart.
1. Set shipping address and billing address for the cart.
1. Check the cart's grand_total.
1. Apply store credit to the cart using the following GraphQL request:

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
mutation {
  applyStoreCreditToCart(
    input: { cart_id: "%cartId%" }
  ) {
    cart {
      prices {
        grand_total {
          currency
          value
        }
      }
      applied_store_credit {
        applied_balance {
          currency
          value
        }
        current_balance {
          currency
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The value of applied_store_credit is applied accurately, and cart totals are correctly reflected in the API response.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

The value of applied_store_credit is applied twice, affecting both the cart and grand_total.
