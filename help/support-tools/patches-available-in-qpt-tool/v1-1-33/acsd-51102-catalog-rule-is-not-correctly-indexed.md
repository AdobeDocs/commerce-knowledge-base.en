## Issue

A catalog rule that is applied to a large number of products is not correctly indexed when the rule is enabled by a scheduled update.

Prerequisites:

* Cron job is setup and runs every minute.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an order with a *Gift Card* and a *simple product* (e.g., *add: SKU: GI000XX000XXX, SKU: PC046CP042076*) â€“ (any payment and shipping method works).
2. Invoice the order.
3. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Gift Card accounts]**. An account is created for the gift card.
4. Now go to **[!UICONTROL Order]**, and create a **[!UICONTROL Credit Memo]**.
5. Change the quantity for the *Gift Card* to 0 and update it. This will create a partial refund for the *simple product*.
6. Click on **[!UICONTROL Refund]**.
7. Now refresh the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Gift Card accounts]**. The newly created account is deleted.

<u>Expected results</u>

The gift card account is available for use as the refund was not created for the gift card.

<u>Actual results</u>

The gift card account is deleted, and the gift card is not refunded.
